# Project Charter: AGI Evaluation Sandbox

**Project Name**: AGI Evaluation Sandbox  
**Project Code**: agi-eval-sandbox  
**Charter Version**: 1.0  
**Last Updated**: 2025-08-02  

## Executive Summary

The AGI Evaluation Sandbox is a comprehensive, standardized platform for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI systems across established benchmarks. This project aims to become the de facto standard for AI evaluation, enabling researchers, organizations, and developers to reliably measure AI progress and compare models systematically.

## Problem Statement

### Current State
- **Fragmented Evaluation**: Multiple isolated evaluation frameworks with inconsistent methodologies
- **Setup Complexity**: Significant time investment required to configure evaluation environments  
- **Inconsistent Metrics**: Lack of standardized metrics and comparison methodologies
- **Poor Integration**: Limited CI/CD and workflow integration capabilities
- **Scalability Issues**: Difficulty evaluating models at scale or in distributed environments

### Pain Points
- Researchers spend 60%+ of time on evaluation setup vs. actual research
- Inconsistent evaluation results across different platforms make comparisons unreliable
- Manual evaluation processes are error-prone and time-consuming
- Limited visibility into evaluation progress and historical performance trends
