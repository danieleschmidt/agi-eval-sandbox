# Performance Optimization Documentation

This directory contains performance optimization guidelines, best practices, and improvement documentation generated by the Terragon Autonomous SDLC Enhancement Engine.

## Directory Structure

- `database-optimization.md` - Database performance improvement strategies
- `async-optimization.md` - Asynchronous programming optimization guidelines  
- `imports-optimization.md` - Import performance optimization techniques
- `algorithms-optimization.md` - Algorithm and data structure optimization
- `monitoring/` - Performance monitoring and profiling guides
- `benchmarks/` - Performance benchmarking documentation

## Performance Monitoring

The autonomous system continuously monitors for performance optimization opportunities through:

- Static code analysis for performance anti-patterns
- Database query analysis for N+1 problems
- Import time profiling for startup optimization
- Algorithm complexity analysis for hot code paths

## Optimization Workflow

1. **Discovery**: Automated identification of performance bottlenecks
2. **Prioritization**: Value-based scoring of optimization opportunities
3. **Implementation**: Guided optimization with documentation and best practices
4. **Validation**: Performance regression testing and benchmarking
5. **Monitoring**: Continuous performance monitoring and alerting
