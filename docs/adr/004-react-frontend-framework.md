# ADR-004: React Frontend Framework Selection

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need a frontend framework for the web dashboard that supports:
- Real-time updates for evaluation progress
- Complex data visualization and charting
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile
- Strong TypeScript support
- Large ecosystem of UI components and libraries
- Good performance for data-heavy interfaces

## Decision
We will use React 18 with TypeScript for the web dashboard frontend.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Largest ecosystem of components and libraries
- Excellent TypeScript support and tooling
- Strong community and extensive documentation
- React 18 features (Suspense, Concurrent Features) improve UX
- Proven track record for complex data visualization apps
- Good integration with state management solutions

### Negative
- Larger learning curve for developers unfamiliar with React
- Can lead to over-engineering for simple components
- Bundle size can be large without proper optimization

## Alternatives Considered

### Vue.js 3
- **Pros**: Easier learning curve, excellent developer experience, good performance
- **Cons**: Smaller ecosystem, less enterprise adoption, fewer visualization libraries

### Svelte/SvelteKit
- **Pros**: Excellent performance, smaller bundle size, innovative approach
- **Cons**: Smaller ecosystem, limited enterprise tooling, fewer developers

### Angular
- **Pros**: Full framework with everything included, excellent TypeScript support
- **Cons**: Heavy and complex, steep learning curve, over-engineered for our needs

## Implementation Notes
- Use Vite for fast development builds and HMR
- Implement React 18 Suspense for better loading states
- Use Redux Toolkit with RTK Query for state management
- Implement code splitting for better performance
- Use React.memo and useMemo for optimization
