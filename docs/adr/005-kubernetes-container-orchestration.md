# ADR-005: Kubernetes for Container Orchestration

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need a container orchestration platform that provides:
- Horizontal scaling for evaluation workers based on demand
- Service discovery and load balancing
- Rolling deployments with zero downtime
- Resource management and scheduling
- Health checking and automatic recovery
- Multi-cloud and on-premises deployment support

## Decision
We will use Kubernetes as our container orchestration platform for production deployments.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Industry standard with massive ecosystem and community
- Excellent horizontal scaling and resource management
- Built-in service discovery and load balancing
- Rich monitoring and observability integrations
- Multi-cloud portability
- Comprehensive RBAC and security features

### Negative
- Complex setup and operational overhead
- Steep learning curve for development teams
- Can be over-engineered for simple deployments
- Requires dedicated operations expertise

## Alternatives Considered

### Docker Swarm
- **Pros**: Simpler setup, native Docker integration, easier learning curve
- **Cons**: Limited ecosystem, fewer advanced features, less enterprise adoption

### AWS ECS/Fargate
- **Pros**: Managed service, simpler operations, good AWS integration
- **Cons**: Vendor lock-in, limited multi-cloud support, fewer features

### Nomad
- **Pros**: Simpler than Kubernetes, good for mixed workloads, HashiCorp ecosystem
- **Cons**: Smaller ecosystem, less enterprise adoption, limited PaaS features

## Implementation Notes
- Use managed Kubernetes services (EKS, GKE, AKS) for production
- Implement Helm charts for standardized deployments
- Use horizontal pod autoscaling for evaluation workers
- Implement proper resource requests and limits
- Use network policies for security isolation
- Set up comprehensive monitoring with Prometheus operator
