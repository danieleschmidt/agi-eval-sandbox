# ADR-001: FastAPI Web Framework Selection

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need to select a web framework for the API Gateway and backend services. The framework must support:
- High-performance async/await patterns for concurrent evaluations
- Automatic OpenAPI documentation generation
- Strong typing support with Python type hints
- Easy testing and development experience
- Production-ready with comprehensive middleware support

## Decision
We will use FastAPI as our primary web framework for all backend services.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Excellent performance with async/await support
- Automatic OpenAPI/Swagger documentation generation
- Built-in data validation with Pydantic models
- Strong typing support improves code quality and IDE experience
- Large community and active development
- Easy integration with modern Python ecosystem

### Negative
- Relatively newer framework compared to Django/Flask
- Smaller ecosystem of third-party packages
- Learning curve for teams unfamiliar with async Python

## Alternatives Considered

### Django REST Framework
- **Pros**: Mature ecosystem, excellent admin interface, comprehensive ORM
- **Cons**: Sync-only (pre-4.1), heavier for API-only services, more complex for simple use cases

### Flask
- **Pros**: Lightweight, flexible, large ecosystem
- **Cons**: Requires many additional packages for production use, async support is limited

### Tornado
- **Pros**: Built for async, good performance
- **Cons**: Lower-level framework, less developer-friendly, smaller community

## Implementation Notes
- Use FastAPI 0.100+ for latest features and security updates
- Implement consistent error handling across all services
- Use dependency injection for shared components (database, auth, etc.)
- Follow FastAPI best practices for project structure
