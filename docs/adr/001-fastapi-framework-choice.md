# ADR-001: FastAPI Framework Choice

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need a web framework for the API Gateway and backend services that supports:
- High performance async operations
- Automatic API documentation
- Type safety with Python type hints
- Easy testing and development
- Modern Python ecosystem integration

## Decision
We will use FastAPI as our primary web framework for all backend services.

## Consequences
**Positive:**
- Built-in OpenAPI documentation generation
- Excellent async/await support for high concurrency
- Automatic request/response validation with Pydantic
- Type hints provide better IDE support and fewer runtime errors
- Growing ecosystem and community support

**Negative:**
- Newer framework with potentially less stability than Django/Flask
- Smaller ecosystem compared to Django
- Team learning curve for async patterns

## Alternatives Considered
- **Django**: Too heavyweight for API-only services, sync-first architecture
- **Flask**: Lacks built-in async support and automatic documentation
- **Starlette**: FastAPI is built on Starlette, so we get the same performance benefits

## Implementation Notes
- Use FastAPI 0.100+ for all new services
- Implement consistent error handling patterns across services
- Use dependency injection for database connections and auth
- Follow FastAPI best practices for project structure
