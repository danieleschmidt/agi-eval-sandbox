# ADR-002: PostgreSQL with TimescaleDB for Data Storage

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need a database solution that can handle:
- Complex relational data (models, benchmarks, evaluations, results)
- Time-series data for longitudinal tracking and performance monitoring
- ACID compliance for data integrity
- Horizontal scaling capabilities
- Rich query capabilities for analytics and reporting

## Decision
We will use PostgreSQL 15+ as our primary database with TimescaleDB extension for time-series data.

## Consequences

### Positive
- ACID compliance ensures data integrity for critical evaluation results
- Rich SQL support enables complex analytics queries
- TimescaleDB provides excellent time-series performance
- Mature ecosystem with extensive tooling and monitoring
- Strong consistency model suitable for evaluation workflows
- JSON/JSONB support for flexible metadata storage

### Negative
- More complex setup compared to NoSQL alternatives
- Vertical scaling limitations (though TimescaleDB helps)
- Requires careful query optimization for large datasets

## Alternatives Considered

### MongoDB
- **Pros**: Flexible schema, horizontal scaling, developer-friendly
- **Cons**: Eventual consistency issues, less mature analytics capabilities

### ClickHouse
- **Pros**: Excellent analytical performance, compression
- **Cons**: Limited transactional support, complex for operational data

### InfluxDB + PostgreSQL
- **Pros**: Purpose-built for time-series, PostgreSQL for relational
- **Cons**: Complexity of managing two databases, data consistency challenges

## Implementation Notes
- Use PostgreSQL 15+ for latest performance improvements
- Install TimescaleDB extension for metrics and longitudinal data
- Implement proper indexing strategy for common query patterns
- Use connection pooling (PgBouncer) for production deployments
- Set up read replicas for analytics workloads
