# ADR-003: Celery with Redis for Distributed Task Processing

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need a distributed task processing system for:
- Long-running evaluation jobs
- Parallel benchmark execution
- Background report generation
- Scheduled maintenance tasks
- Fault tolerance and retry logic

## Decision
We will use Celery with Redis as the message broker for distributed task processing.

## Consequences
**Positive:**
- Mature and battle-tested in production environments
- Excellent integration with Python ecosystem
- Built-in retry logic and error handling
- Flexible routing and priority queues
- Good monitoring and debugging tools
- Redis provides fast message broker and result backend

**Negative:**
- Additional infrastructure complexity (Redis cluster)
- Python-only solution (language lock-in)
- Memory usage can be high for large task queues
- Serialization overhead for complex task arguments

## Alternatives Considered
- **RQ**: Simpler but less feature-complete than Celery
- **Apache Airflow**: Overkill for simple task execution, workflow-focused
- **Kubernetes Jobs**: Less flexible for dynamic task generation
- **AWS SQS + Lambda**: Vendor lock-in, cold start latency

## Implementation Notes
- Use Redis Cluster for high availability message broker
- Implement task result compression for large payloads
- Set up separate queues for different task types (evaluation, reporting)
- Use Celery Beat for scheduled tasks
- Implement comprehensive task monitoring with Flower
- Use task routing for GPU vs CPU workers
