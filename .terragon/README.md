# Terragon Autonomous SDLC Enhancement Engine

This directory contains the Terragon Autonomous SDLC Enhancement Engine - a perpetual value-maximizing system that continuously discovers and executes the highest-value work in your repository.

## System Overview

The autonomous system operates through multiple interconnected components:

- **Value Discovery Engine** (`value-discovery-engine.py`): Continuously scans for improvement opportunities
- **Autonomous Executor** (`autonomous-executor.py`): Executes high-value tasks with comprehensive validation
- **Configuration System** (`config.yaml`): Adaptive configuration based on repository maturity
- **Value Metrics** (`value-metrics.json`): Comprehensive tracking of delivered value

## Key Features

### üîç Continuous Value Discovery
- **Multi-Source Signal Harvesting**: Git history, static analysis, security scans, dependency analysis
- **Advanced Prioritization**: WSJF (Weighted Shortest Job First) and ICE (Impact, Confidence, Ease) scoring
- **Technical Debt Tracking**: Automated identification and quantification of technical debt
- **Risk Assessment**: Comprehensive risk analysis for all discovered work items

### üöÄ Autonomous Execution
- **Self-Contained Task Execution**: Complete task lifecycle management
- **Comprehensive Validation**: Multi-stage testing and quality assurance
- **Automatic Rollback**: Failed tasks trigger immediate rollback procedures
- **Value Tracking**: Real-time measurement of delivered business value

### üìä Intelligent Prioritization
- **Composite Scoring**: Multi-factor scoring combining business value, technical impact, and execution confidence
- **Adaptive Weighting**: Repository maturity-based weight adjustment for optimal prioritization
- **Risk-Adjusted Selection**: Intelligent task selection based on risk tolerance and execution confidence
- **Continuous Learning**: Scoring model improvement based on execution outcomes

## Repository Maturity Assessment

Current Repository Status: **MATURING (65% SDLC Maturity)**

### Maturity Indicators
- ‚úÖ Advanced project structure with comprehensive documentation
- ‚úÖ Modern technology stack (FastAPI, PostgreSQL, React, Docker)
- ‚úÖ Robust configuration and tooling setup
- ‚úÖ Security framework and compliance documentation
- ‚úÖ Monitoring and observability infrastructure
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited source code relative to documentation depth
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Missing automated value discovery implementation

### Enhancement Strategy
The system focuses on **Maturing Repository** enhancements:
- Advanced testing and quality assurance
- Comprehensive security improvements
- Operational excellence optimization
- Developer experience enhancements
- Performance optimization automation

## Usage

### Manual Execution
```bash
# Run value discovery
python3 .terragon/value-discovery-engine.py

# Execute autonomous task
python3 .terragon/autonomous-executor.py
```

### Automated Integration
See `docs/workflows/AUTONOMOUS_INTEGRATION.md` for GitHub Actions integration.

## Value Metrics

The system continuously tracks:
- **Total Value Score**: Cumulative business value delivered
- **Task Completion Rate**: Success rate of autonomous task execution
- **Security Improvements**: Number of security issues resolved
- **Performance Gains**: Measurable performance improvements
- **Technical Debt Reduction**: Quantified debt reduction achievements

## Configuration

The system adapts its behavior based on repository maturity:

- **Scoring Weights**: Adjusted based on repository needs (WSJF, ICE, Technical Debt)
- **Risk Thresholds**: Conservative thresholds for production repositories
- **Discovery Sources**: Comprehensive scanning of all available signals
- **Execution Policies**: Safe execution with comprehensive validation

## Security and Safety

- **Comprehensive Validation**: All changes validated before application
- **Rollback Capabilities**: Automatic rollback on validation failure
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all autonomous activities
- **Risk Assessment**: Continuous risk evaluation and mitigation
- **Human Oversight**: All significant changes go through PR review process

## Integration Points

- **GitHub Actions**: Seamless integration with existing CI/CD pipelines
- **Development Workflow**: Compatible with standard Git workflows
- **Monitoring Systems**: Integration with existing monitoring and alerting
- **Quality Gates**: Respects existing quality and security gates

## Continuous Improvement

The system continuously improves through:
- **Learning from Execution**: Scoring model refinement based on outcomes
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identification of recurring improvement opportunities
- **Velocity Optimization**: Process optimization for faster value delivery
- **Feedback Integration**: Incorporation of team feedback and preferences
