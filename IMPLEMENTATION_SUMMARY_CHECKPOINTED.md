# Checkpointed SDLC Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the complete checkpointed Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) implementation for the AGI Evaluation Sandbox project. The implementation follows a systematic approach with discrete checkpoints to ensure reliable progress tracking and handle GitHub permission limitations.

## Implementation Strategy

The SDLC implementation was executed through **8 discrete checkpoints**, each representing a logical grouping of changes that can be safely committed and pushed independently. This approach provides:

- **Granular Progress Tracking**: Each checkpoint can be verified independently
- **Permission Handling**: Separates changes requiring GitHub App permissions from those that don't  
- **Rollback Safety**: Each checkpoint can be rolled back without affecting others
- **Collaborative Review**: Each checkpoint can be reviewed separately for focused feedback
