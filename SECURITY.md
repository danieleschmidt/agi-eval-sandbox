- CSRF protection for web interfaces
- File upload restrictions and virus scanning

### Infrastructure Security
- Container security scanning with Trivy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in AGI Evaluation Sandbox, please report it responsibly:

### Preferred Method: Security Advisory
1. Go to the [Security Advisories](https://github.com/your-org/agi-eval-sandbox/security/advisories) page
2. Click "Report a vulnerability"
3. Fill out the advisory form with detailed information
4. Submit the report

### Alternative Method: Email
Send an email to: **security@your-org.com**

Include the following information:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Any proof-of-concept code (if applicable)
- Your contact information for follow-up

### What to Expect

| Timeline | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Within 24 hours | Initial response acknowledging receipt |
| Within 3 business days | Preliminary assessment and triage |
| Within 7 business days | Detailed investigation results |
| Within 30 days | Fix development and testing |
| Upon fix deployment | Public disclosure coordination |

## Responsible Disclosure

We follow coordinated vulnerability disclosure principles:

### Our Commitment
- We will respond to your report within 24 hours
- We will provide regular updates on our progress
- We will credit you in our security advisory (if desired)
- We will not take legal action against good-faith security research

### Your Commitment
- Give us reasonable time to investigate and fix the issue
- Do not publicly disclose the vulnerability until we've had a chance to address it
- Do not access or modify data that doesn't belong to you
- Do not perform actions that could harm our users or infrastructure

## Security Best Practices for Users

### For Administrators
- Use strong, unique passwords for all accounts
- Enable two-factor authentication where available
- Regularly update the AGI Evaluation Sandbox to the latest version
- Monitor security logs and alerts
- Follow the principle of least privilege for user accounts
- Regularly review and audit user access

### For Developers
- Keep all dependencies up to date
- Use secure coding practices
- Regularly run security scans on your code
- Follow our secure development guidelines
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Never commit secrets or credentials to version control

### For End Users
- Use strong, unique passwords
- Be cautious with API keys and tokens
- Report suspicious activities immediately
- Keep your client applications updated
- Follow data handling best practices

## Security Architecture

### Network Security
```
Internet → Load Balancer (TLS Termination) → Application (Internal Network) → Database (Private Network)
```

### Authentication Flow
```
User → OAuth Provider → AGI Eval Auth → JWT Token → API Access
```

### Data Flow Security
```
Client Request → Rate Limiting → Authentication → Authorization → Input Validation → Business Logic → Response Sanitization → Client
```

## Security Testing

We employ multiple layers of security testing:

### Automated Testing
- **SAST (Static Application Security Testing)**: CodeQL, Semgrep
- **DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing)**: OWASP ZAP
- **Dependency Scanning**: Safety, npm audit, Snyk
- **Container Scanning**: Trivy, Hadolint
- **Infrastructure Scanning**: Checkov, Terraform security

### Manual Testing
- Periodic penetration testing by security professionals
- Code reviews with security focus
- Architecture security reviews
- Threat modeling exercises

### Continuous Monitoring
- Real-time vulnerability detection
- Security incident response
- Compliance monitoring
- Performance impact assessment

## Incident Response

### Classification Levels

| Level | Description | Response Time | Escalation |
|-------|-------------|---------------|------------|
| **Critical** | Active exploitation, data breach | 1 hour | Immediate executive notification |
| **High** | Publicly disclosed vulnerability | 4 hours | Security team lead notification |
| **Medium** | Limited impact vulnerability | 24 hours | Standard team notification |
| **Low** | Minor security issue | 72 hours | Regular team review |

### Response Process
1. **Detection & Triage**: Identify and classify the incident
2. **Containment**: Isolate affected systems
3. **Investigation**: Determine root cause and impact
4. **Eradication**: Remove the threat and vulnerabilities
5. **Recovery**: Restore systems to normal operation
6. **Lessons Learned**: Document and improve processes
